       "5     articles featuring the new book!short literature pro market 2019 has been featured on several websites and i would like to share those with you. i also wrote a guest article on rachel poli’s website that i’ll link to below, titled 15 tips to get your short story or article published. trust me, it will provide insight!it’s time for the second sales update! i published my first blog post on february 9th, so it’s only been about three weeks, but a few things have gone on since then.echo 1 is free for today and tomorrow! echo 2, 3, and 4 are $0.99 for four more days!short literature pro market ’19 is out!the newest edition in the pro market brand is out and available for purchase this weekend. this new version has even more publishers inside, with the same great detail as the last one. this time you get over 170 profession paying publishers. something else that’s different about the 2019 edition is that it has been widened to include other types of publishers besides just short stories. it also includes freelance publishers, nonfiction, article segments and more. you can find short literature pro market 2019 available as an ebook or paperback the current price for the ebook is only $3.99 (normally $6.99) and the sale price for the paperback is $9.99 (normally $13.99). so, it’s a good time to save money too! but act soon because these prices will only be available through the end of february.grab your copy on sale here.thanks for check out my blog!this is the first installment/update effort in tracking my sales and marketing efforts for short literature pro market 2019. as stated in a previous post, i am going to attempt to update my blog semi-regularly with this information. this book is independently published and the only marketing budget is what comes out of my pocket. there is no publishing house budget.pre-order the lost years by stacey ritz, published by rockville publishing. the release date is march 1st!i decided i’m going to run a blog series where i document the sales and marketing efforts of my recent works as an independent & self-published author. many people who have never seen behind the curtain of self-publishing often don’t understand the difficulties of marketing and financing your own books. it is a struggle that is very real and can be very expensive. there are plenty of independently published books that are of the same quality as traditionally published books – but there aren’t usually the same kind of connections and backing to push those books to success.so, i’m going to share my efforts on my blog every few weeks. what works, what clearly doesn’t. what i’ve tried so far and what i want to try. also, i will try to stay transparent with the sales numbers and what has been invested. the first book i’m going to track is my newest book currently out for pre-order, short literature pro market 2019.\n",
